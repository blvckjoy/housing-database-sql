# Housing Database SQL

This repository contains T-SQL scripts for creating and managing a relational database designed for housing and real estate data. The database models information about houses, neighborhoods, sales, and agents, making it suitable for learning, analytics, and small-scale real estate projects.

---

## Features

- **SQL Server (T-SQL) Scripts**: Schema creation, sample data, and example queries.
- **Normalized Schema**: Separate tables for houses, neighborhoods, sales, and agents, with relationships enforced by foreign keys.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Clear structure that makes it easy to understand, extend, and query.

## Example Queries

- **Find unsold houses:**
    ```sql
    SELECT h.address, h.price, n.name AS neighborhood
    FROM houses h
    JOIN neighborhoods n ON h.neighborhood_id = n.neighborhood_id
    LEFT JOIN sales s ON h.house_id = s.house_id
    WHERE s.sale_id IS NULL;
    ```

- **List houses with a garage in high-income neighborhoods:**
    ```sql
    SELECT h.address, h.price, n.name
    FROM houses h
    JOIN neighborhoods n ON h.neighborhood_id = n.neighborhood_id
    WHERE h.garage = 1 AND n.average_income > 80000;
    ```

- **Top agents by number of sales:**
    ```sql
    SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name, COUNT(s.sale_id) AS num_sales
    FROM agents a
    LEFT JOIN sales s ON a.agent_id = s.agent_id
    GROUP BY a.agent_id, a.first_name, a.last_name
    ORDER BY num_sales DESC;
    ```
